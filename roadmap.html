    The EtherGem Whitepaper is currently being updated to include the details of our integrated subchain. While this is in progress, here are
    some basics about the EGEM Chain:

    <p>
      Ethergem is the foundational currency platform with an integrated subchain that starts by replicating the stable ethereum core to avoid
      a reinvention of the wheel and focus on the solutions needed for a decentralized Marketplace. The integration of a subchain allows for
      tokens to become coins with their own blockchain and consensus while maintaining the dapp infrastructure we have become accustomed to.
      The resulting chain structure adds enhancements to scalability, transactional throughput, and technical capabilities available on very
      few platforms in today's crypto environment.

        EtherGem, "EGEM," is first and foremost a pure community-based coin with no pre mine. True to EGEM’s roots as a cryptocurrency,
        the Proof of Work mining community will always be a part of the EGEM future and is the foundation of the EGEM launch.
        There is no ICO on EGEM and EGEM is its own primary blockchain, not just a token or concept on another chain. The EtherGem
        blockchain is an ethereum network, meaning the blockchain starts with the tested and proven ethereum (as in ETH) core technologies
        and builds from there. Technically EGEM is an Ethereum chain as described in the yellow paper, with EIP150, EIP155, EIP158
        applied from block 0. Block Rewards have 7 Eras of reduction, including a dev reward enabled after block 5000. Developers
        and Community Managers are bound by a continuity agreement to maintain the network, community, and coin. There is no supply
        cap to EGEM at the moment. A monetary cap will be put in place when the community determines that a logical progression would be
        to cap the total supply of the coin.

        Working Product and Community came first, therefore our Roadmap is evolving....<br />
        The core EtherGem developers were already working on production ethereum products, so our roadmap begins with a working product and takes off
        from that point. That means we inherited all of the Ethereum stable core, smart contracts, and tokenization capabilities, with an altered
        difficulty that produces a shorter block time (13 seconds). We began adding enhancements like the
        Quarrynodes and integrated subchain. Since March (our launch) we have ben listed on multiple exchanges, refined our stable core, released
        the Quarrynodes, a custom desktop wallet (Opal), built a terrific discord and telegram community, attended the Blockchain World Conference, hosted
        an ICO (Validity - formerly Division X) on our chain, developed the integrated subchain in the labs, we are operating on Trezor, recognized
        by CoinMarketCap and MyEtherWallet, and have planned for a fantastic 2019. It is now
        time to formalize our plans and hidden technology in the upcoming whitepaper. The plans for this release are in sync with the Sapphire
        testnet and should be in the next quarter. At that time we will provide the roadmap for the next year or two.

      <li style="border:1px solid #CCCC; padding:20px; margin:20px; background-color:#ffffe6;">
        An "applied technologies peernet" is the EtherGem blockchain’s integrated subchain structure. Dual mining EtherGem and an integrated coin on
        claymore is something new. The EGEM integrated subchain (code named Sapphire) is designed to be a platform that enhances the EGEM experience
        by allowing other coins to list on it as a Decentralized Exchange (DEX).
        Sapphire is very much an integral part of ongoing mainchain development where peers can implement new technology while continuing to rely on a
        solid foundation.  The Sapphire subchain is currently in late stage development and early testing in the EGEM labs. We expect to see this product
        release over the next quarter. A lot of excitement is surrounding the Sapphire subchain because early EGEM miners and HODLers get a 2:1 Sapphire : EGEM
        airdrop at a to be released snapshot. Combined with the Quarrynodes, we feel that the sponsored Sapphire expansion will bring the EtherGem chain into
        mainstream use.

      <li style="border:1px solid #CCCC; padding:20px; margin:20px; background-color:#ffffe6;">
        A Quarry Node (QN) is the backbone of the EtherGem ecosystem. QNs function as masternodes: user maintained virtual private servers that require
        EGEM collateral [10k primary + 30k secondary] and in return for supporting the network's transactions, they earn the holder a daily fixed ammount of EGEM income.
        While Sapphire (the subchain) is in beta, the QN's reward come from the DevFund. After Sapphire is released, the goals for the QNs is to provide
        rewards will be added based on the EGEM network's transactions and the fees paid for the DEX listings.

        A Sapphire Sponsor Node (SpN) is similar to a Quarry Node, but instead of EGEM they will require some Sapphire collateral locked. These VPS
        are going to support the subchain infrastructure while providing the holders with Sapphire rewards. The ammount of Sapphire collateral
        required for a SpN will be calculated before release, based on the 2:1 (SPHR:EGEM) airdrop.

        A single Quarry Node and a Sapphire Sponsore Node will be able to coexist on the same VPS, providing both services to the network.
